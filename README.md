# libardo-tic-tac-toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking three spaces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on a 3x3 grid with their chosen symbol (usually X or O) to win. The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins the game. If all nine spaces are filled without a winner, the game results in a tie or draw.
